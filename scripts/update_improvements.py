# We need to recalculate the score for all pending items.
# Themes:
# Frontend/UI UX: #1, #3, #6, #8, #23 (5 items) -> Decay: 0.5^4 (wait, halving per *already shipped* item in the same theme. So 1st = 1.0, 2nd = 0.5, 3rd = 0.25, 4th = 0.125, 5th = 0.0625. If 5 are shipped, the next one is the 6th, so decay is 0.5^5 = 0.03125)
# DevOps: #2, #16 (2 items) -> Decay: 0.5^2 = 0.25
# Data Pipeline: #5, #12, #14 (3 items) -> Decay: 0.5^3 = 0.125
# Data Transparency: #4, #8 (wait, 8 was UI/UX and Data Transparency. Let's count it as Data Transparency). 4 and 8 shipped. Decay: 0.5^2 = 0.25
# Collaboration Metrics: 11, 13, 15, 19, 20. None shipped yet. Decay: 1.0.
