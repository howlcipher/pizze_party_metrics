# 🚀 Improvement Backlog

This document is the authoritative, ranked backlog for the Pizza Party Metrics project.

## Working Protocol

1. **Open a task journal.** Update it and commit at every milestone.
2. **Re-evaluate the model.** Pick the least expensive available model that can do the job well.
3. **Route the crafted skills.** Check the skills manifest for skills matching the task.
4. **Scan for helpful free tools.** Consider whether a free or open source tool would materially improve the work.
5. **Finish the loop.** Every code change ships with relevant automated tests. Verify the change works end to end, commit, and push.

## Ranked Backlog (best ROI first)

Pending rows are ranked by a diminishing-returns score, recomputed at every groom:

**Score = (Value × Decay) ÷ Effort**

- **Value (1–8):** pain or risk removed if the item ships.
- **Decay:** geometric halving per already-shipped item in the same theme (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 …).
- **Effort (1–8):** roughly log-scale; 1 = minutes, 8 = weeks.
- **ROI floor = 0.5:** items scoring below the floor stay open but are flagged ⚠️.

**Context:** Based on the Multi-Agent Taskforce audit using `ui_ux` skills to resolve critical interaction and compliance bugs.
**Status:** Open

### 36. [Agent Suggestion] Data Pipeline: Asynchronous API Execution
**Description:** Rewrite `GitHubClient` using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` to ensure non-blocking network calls with robust pool limits.
**Context:** Based on the Multi-Agent Taskforce audit using `architectural_guardrails`. The current implementation blocks execution synchronously.
**Status:** Open

### 37. [Agent Suggestion] Data Pipeline: Decouple ETL Monolith
**Description:** Break the monolithic `etl.py` script into distinct modules (`extract`, `transform`, `load`). Implement strict schema validation (e.g., `Pandera`).
**Context:** Based on the Multi-Agent Taskforce audit to improve codebase maintainability and cohesion.
**Status:** Open

### 38. [Agent Suggestion] Frontend: Lazy Load Chart Components
**Description:** Use `React.lazy()` and `<Suspense>` to dynamically load heavy charting components (`Recharts`) to optimize Time-To-Interactive (TTI).
**Context:** Based on the Multi-Agent Taskforce audit using `frontend_engineering` to enforce code-splitting.
**Status:** Open

### 39. [Agent Suggestion] Frontend: Migrate Codebase to TypeScript
**Description:** Convert all `.jsx` files to `.tsx` and implement strict typings for props, state, and data fetching.
**Context:** Enforces the strict `frontend_engineering` rule requiring all frontend codebases to be written in TypeScript.
**Status:** Open

### 40. [Agent Suggestion] Accessibility: Use Native HTML5 Dialog
**Description:** Refactor `MethodologyModal.jsx` to use the native HTML5 `<dialog>` element for out-of-the-box keyboard navigation, focus trapping, and screen-reader support.
**Context:** Based on the Multi-Agent Taskforce audit using `accessibility` skills to fix modal interaction friction.
**Status:** Open
