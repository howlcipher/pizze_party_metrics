# 🚀 Improvement Backlog

This document is the authoritative, ranked backlog for the Pizza Party Metrics project.

## Working Protocol

1. **Open a task journal.** Update it and commit at every milestone.
2. **Re-evaluate the model.** Pick the least expensive available model that can do the job well.
3. **Route the crafted skills.** Check the skills manifest for skills matching the task.
4. **Scan for helpful free tools.** Consider whether a free or open source tool would materially improve the work.
5. **Finish the loop.** Every code change ships with relevant automated tests. Verify the change works end to end, commit, and push.

## Ranked Backlog (best ROI first)

Pending rows are ranked by a diminishing-returns score, recomputed at every groom:

**Score = (Value × Decay) ÷ Effort**

- **Value (1–8):** pain or risk removed if the item ships.
- **Decay:** geometric halving per already-shipped item in the same theme (1.0 → 0.5 → 0.25 …).
- **Effort (1–8):** roughly log-scale; 1 = minutes, 8 = weeks.
- **ROI floor = 0.5:** items scoring below the floor stay open but are flagged ⚠️.

**Status:** ⚠️ below floor
**Scoring Note (2026-07-22):** Re-scored below 0.5 ROI floor due to theme decay.
**Scoring Note (2026-07-21):** Re-scored below 0.5 ROI floor due to theme decay.

### 11. 11. [Agent Suggestion] Async Collaboration Velocity Metric
**Description:** Measure and compare PR merge times and issue resolution times across different work setups (remote vs hybrid vs onsite). Use data from GitHub APIs or similar sources to prove that async, remote-first workflows actually lead to faster or higher-quality task completion, countering the claim that in-person collaboration is always faster.
**Context:** Addresses the core product thesis by providing hard data that remote teams can outpace onsite teams when it comes to concrete deliverables.
**Status:** 📅 Pending

### 12. 12. [Agent Suggestion] Data Pipeline: Real GitHub Collaboration Data Integration
**Description:** Expand the `etl.py` script to pull live, real-world data (e.g., from WFH Research APIs, GitHub GraphQL, or similar) to accurately power the collaboration and velocity metrics, fulfilling the mandate to strictly use "real data".
**Context:** Ensures that the metrics are not using mock proxies, adhering to data integrity and the project's primary thesis.
**Done note (2026-07-21):** Refactored `etl.py` to fetch issue resolution and PR merge metrics across multiple real-world repositories grouped into distinct organizational styles ('Remote-First', 'Hybrid', 'Onsite-Heavy'). Generated distinct velocity proxies per work setup category and updated `process_data` to power all 280 demographic records in `pizza_metrics.json`. Added comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_etl.py`.

### 13. 13. [Agent Suggestion] Documentation & Knowledge Transfer Health
**Description:** Analyze the volume and quality of written documentation (wiki updates, PR descriptions, ADRs) to prove remote teams over-index on scalable knowledge transfer compared to the ephemeral, unrecorded watercooler chats of onsite teams.
**Context:** Quantifies the often-ignored benefit of remote work: forcing teams to build a robust, searchable knowledge base.
**Status:** 📅 Pending

### 14. 14. Live Data Ingestion API / Backend
**Description:** Build a backend or integration layer (e.g., WebSockets or a polling API) to ingest real and live data for the dashboard, replacing any static or mocked data.
**Context:** Required to fulfill the "real and live data" mandate.
**Done note (2026-07-21):** Implemented a FastAPI backend caching ETL results and proxying Vite to dynamically fetch live GitHub data.

### 15. 15. [Agent Suggestion] Cross-Time-Zone Collaboration Index
**Description:** Highlight the "follow the sun" advantage of remote teams by visualizing 24/7 continuous output metrics. This shows how distributed teams can keep projects moving around the clock without individual burnout.
**Context:** Demonstrates a unique structural advantage of remote work that in-office environments fundamentally cannot replicate.
**Status:** 📅 Pending

### 16. 16. [Agent Suggestion] DevOps: Implement Multi-Stage Job Separation with Quality & Security Gates
**Description:** Split the monolithic `build-and-deploy` job in `deploy.yml` into `validate`, `build`, and `deploy` jobs with security scanning (Trivy/npm audit).
**Context:** Aligns with `devops` constraints ensuring security and logical environment isolation.
**Done note (2026-07-21):** Refactored `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` into `validate`, `build`, and `deploy` jobs. Added `npm audit` and `aquasecurity/trivy-action` scanning to the validation phase.

### 17. 17. Theme Options: Light, Dark, and Color-blind Modes
**Description:** Add a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between Light Mode, Dark Mode (currently default), and a Color-blind friendly mode.
**Context:** This improves accessibility (see `accessibility` skill) and gives users control over their dashboard viewing experience.
**Done note (2026-07-21):** Implemented global theme provider, updated index.css with CSS variables mapped to Tailwind, and added a sleek dropdown in the Header.

### 18. 18. [Agent Suggestion] DevOps: Isolate ETL Data Pipeline and Ensure Idempotency
**Description:** Extract the Python ETL script to its own `data-pipeline` GitHub Actions job and pass the JSON artifact to the `build` job.
**Context:** Ensures absolute separation between the Python execution environment and Node.js build per `devops_sre` standards.
**Status:** ⚠️ below floor
**Done note (2026-07-21):** Extracted the Python ETL script to its own `data-pipeline` GitHub Actions job and passed the JSON artifact to the `build` job.

### 19. 19. [Agent Suggestion] Meeting vs. Maker Time Analysis
**Description:** Analyze calendar data to show the ratio of uninterrupted "Maker Time" versus fragmented "Meeting Time."
**Context:** A natural extension to the context-switching metrics that provides highly actionable insights for teams.
**Status:** 📅 Pending

### 20. 20. Interruption & Context Switch Impact Dashboard
**Description:** Visualize how interruptions destroy context switching. We need to track the frequency of interruptions (e.g., Slack messages, ad-hoc calls) and correlate them with task completion times or velocity drops.
**Context:** This requires tracking the "cost" of a context switch. As defined by the product strategy (MVP), we should start with a simple time-loss calculation before moving to complex models.
**Status:** 📅 Pending
